# Offline fallbacks

With this feature, when fetching (from both cache and network) fails, a precached resource is served rather than an error.

To get started, simply add a `/_offline.tsx` file to `pages/` or a `/~offline/page.tsx` file to `app/`. You are all set!
When the user is offline, all pages that are not cached will fallback to `/_offline`/`/~offline`.

**[Use this example to see it in action](https://github.com/DuCanhGH/next-pwa/tree/master/examples/offline-fallback-v2)**

To also add a fallback for other resources, change your `next.config.js` like so:

```js
import withPWAInit from "@ducanh2912/next-pwa";

const withPWA = withPWAInit({
  // your other options,
  fallbacks: {
    // failed page requests fallback to this.
    document: "/~offline",
    // this is for /_next/.../.json files.
    data: "/fallback.json",
    // this is for images.
    image: "/fallback.webp",
    // this is for audio files.
    audio: "/fallback.mp3",
    // this is for video files.
    video: "/fallback.mp4",
    // this is for fonts.
    font: "/fallback-font.woff2",
  },
});

export default withPWA({
  // your Next config
});
```

`next-pwa` helps you precache those resources on first load, then inject a fallback handler to `handlerDidError` plugin to all
`runtimeCaching` configs, so that precached resources are served when fetching fails.

You can also setup `precacheFallback.fallbackURL` in your [runtimeCaching array](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/workbox/reference/workbox-build/#type-RuntimeCaching)
to implement a similar functionality. The difference is that the above method is based on the resource type, whereas this method is based on matched URL pattern. If this config
is set in the `runtimeCaching` config entry, resource-type-based fallback will be disabled automatically for this particular URL pattern to avoid conflicts.
