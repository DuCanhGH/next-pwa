# Welcome to DuCanh's PWA suite for Next.js!

## Variants

- There are two different variants of this plugin:

  - [`next-pwa`](/next-pwa/getting-started)
  - [`next-sw` (not stable)](/next-sw)

## What's the difference between these two?

- `next-pwa` is a stable package, which makes use of `workbox` to generate the service worker for you. Many available
  configurations are inherited from it. This is the recommended option if you are not sure.
- `next-sw` is NOT stable, and is built from ground up. This one is more limited and lightweight.

## What's the plan for the future?

- In the future, I plan on supporting [`Turbopack`](https://turbo.build/pack) as soon as we get our hands on them.

- I also plan to remove `nextra` from the documentation as it is heavy (every page is `184kb` by default ðŸ¤¯) and doesn't support
  `app/`.
