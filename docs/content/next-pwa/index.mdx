# Introduction

Welcome to the `next-pwa` documentation!

## What is `@ducanh2912/next-pwa`?

`@ducanh2912/next-pwa` is a package that allows you to create a progressive web app with Next.js.

This is the predecessor of `@serwist/next`. If you are just getting started, we recommend using [Serwist](https://serwist.pages.dev) instead.

## How to configure it?

## Does it support offline mode?

Out of the box, JavaScript, CSS, and images assets are precached, and pages are cached as you visits them. You can also enable [offline
fallbacks](/docs/next-pwa/offline-fallbacks) to handle uncached assets and pages.
