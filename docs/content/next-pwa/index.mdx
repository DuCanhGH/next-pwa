# Introduction

Welcome to the `next-pwa` documentation!

## What is `next-pwa`?

`next-pwa` is a plugin for Next.js that allows you to create a progressive web app with it.

With it, building a PWA is simply painless, just drop `withPWA` into your `next.config.js` and you are already good to go!

It is also really configurable as it uses Workbox under the hood to build the service worker.

## How to install `next-pwa`?

See [Getting started](/docs/next-pwa/getting-started). It should have abundant information on how to set the plugin up, including additional information for
older versions of Next.js and tips!

## How to configure it?

See [Configuring](/docs/next-pwa/configuring). All available options are listed there!

## Does it support offline mode?

Yes! Offline mode is supported out of the box. Assets such as `.js` files, `.css` files, images are automatically cached as they are requested (some are even
precached!). Pages are also cached as you visits them. If you are offline before they are cached, you won't be disappointed still [should you have offline
fallbacks enabled](/docs/next-pwa/offline-fallbacks).
