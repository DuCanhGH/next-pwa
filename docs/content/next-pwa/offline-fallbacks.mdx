# Offline support

`next-pwa` has built-in offline support for both Pages Router and App Router. By default, it caches HTML requests, RSC requests, and RSC precaches
separately. This behavior can be overridden with `workboxOptions.runtimeCaching`.

## Development mode

By default, in development mode, `next-pwa` sets every resource to be served from the network only to ensure that the app works as expected.

If you see the behavior where your app reloads infinitely, it might be because you have disabled `next-pwa` from building a service worker in
development mode, in which case, try unregistering its service worker, which might have been installed by a production build of your app before,
if it exists.

## Offline fallbacks

Sometimes fetching from both the cache and the network fails, in which case a resource can be setup to be precached and served in place of an error.

To enable this behavior for pages, simply add a `/_offline.tsx` file to `pages/` or a `/~offline/page.tsx` file to `app/`. You are all set!
When the user is offline, all pages that are not cached will fallback to `/_offline` (or `/~offline` if you are using App Router).
[You can use this example to see it in action.](https://github.com/DuCanhGH/next-pwa/tree/master/examples/offline-fallback-v2)

To also add a fallback for other resources, change your `next.config.js` like so:

<Tabs>

```js
// title next.config.js
const withPWA = require("@ducanh2912/next-pwa").default({
  // Your other options,
  fallbacks: {
    // Failed page requests fallback to this.
    document: "/~offline",
    // This is for /_next/.../.json files.
    data: "/fallback.json",
    // This is for images.
    image: "/fallback.webp",
    // This is for audio files.
    audio: "/fallback.mp3",
    // This is for video files.
    video: "/fallback.mp4",
    // This is for fonts.
    font: "/fallback-font.woff2",
  },
});

module.exports = withPWA({
  // Your Next.js config
});
```

```js
// title next.config.mjs
import withPWAInit from "@ducanh2912/next-pwa";

const withPWA = withPWAInit({
  // Your other options,
  fallbacks: {
    // Failed page requests fallback to this.
    document: "/~offline",
    // This is for /_next/.../.json files.
    data: "/fallback.json",
    // This is for images.
    image: "/fallback.webp",
    // This is for audio files.
    audio: "/fallback.mp3",
    // This is for video files.
    video: "/fallback.mp4",
    // This is for fonts.
    font: "/fallback-font.woff2",
  },
});

export default withPWA({
  // Your Next.js config
});
```

</Tabs>

`next-pwa` helps you precache those resources on first load, then inject a fallback handler to `handlerDidError` plugin to all
`runtimeCaching` entries, so that precached resources are served when fetching fails.

You can also setup `precacheFallback.fallbackURL` in your [runtimeCaching array](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/workbox/reference/workbox-build/#type-RuntimeCaching)
to implement a similar functionality. The difference is that the above method is based on the resource type, whereas this method is based on matched URL pattern. If this config
is set in any `runtimeCaching` entry, the aforementioned resource-based method will be disabled for that particular entry to avoid conflicts.
