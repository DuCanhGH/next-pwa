# Precaching

## Default

By default, this is set to `[/\/_next\/static\/.*(?<!\.p)\.woff2/, /\.map$/, /^manifest.*\.js$/]`.

### Why?

#### Fonts

`next/font` includes all subsets out of the box. However, precaching all of them might be prove to be too heavy on the users' devices, so they have been excluded by default.

#### `.map` files

These files do not serve any purpose to the users. As such, the plugin does not precache them by default.

#### `.manifest.*.js` files

This is to make sure we don't precache, e.g., the precache manifest file, or other manifests that are commonly generated by webpack but not useful for the users.

## JS files

By default, all JS files are precached. However, this behaviour is not desired for larger apps. If your app fits this criterion, it is recommend that you
manually filter out JS files that are not necessary.
