# Custom worker

`next-pwa` will automatically detect `worker/index.{js,ts}`, and bundle the file into `dest` as `worker-*.js` using `webpack`.
It's also automatically injected into the generated `sw.js`. In this way, you get the benefit of code splitting automatically.
You can share logic between your web app and this worker (path aliases do work). You can even import npm packages there!

This is where you can write your custom worker logic.

For example, to disable `workbox`'s logging, you can simply add `self.__WB_DISABLE_DEV_LOGS = true` to it.

You can change the directory of your custom worker file by adding `customWorkerDir` (this path is relative to `baseDir`):

```js
const withPWA = require("@ducanh2912/next-pwa").default({
  customWorkerDir: "serviceworker",
  // ...
});
```

In this example, `next-pwa` will look for `serviceworker/index.ts`.
