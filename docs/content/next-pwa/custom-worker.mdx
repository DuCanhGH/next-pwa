# Custom worker

`next-pwa` allows you to inject some custom code into the generated service worker. By default, this code should be located at `worker/index.{js,ts}`.
The plugin will check if the file exists and bundle the file to `dest/worker-*.js` if it does.

<Callout variant="warning">
  Do not use this feature to write critical worker code that your application depends on to function. Again, the service worker should function as an
  enhancement, not something critical to your application.
</Callout>

You can change the directory in which `next-pwa` looks for a custom worker implementation and change the directory in which `next-pwa` outputs the bundled
worker:

```js
const withPWA = require("@ducanh2912/next-pwa").default({
  customWorkerSrc: "service-worker",
  customWorkerDest: "somewhere-else", // defaults to `dest`
  customWorkerPrefix: "not/a-worker",
  // ...
});

module.exports = withPWA({
  // Your Next.js config
});
```

```js
import withPWAInit from "@ducanh2912/next-pwa";

const withPWA = withPWAInit({
  customWorkerSrc: "service-worker",
  customWorkerDest: "somewhere-else", // defaults to `dest`
  customWorkerPrefix: "not/a-worker",
  // ...
});

export default withPWA({
  // Your Next.js config
});
```

</Tabs>

In this example, `next-pwa` will look for `service-worker/index.{js,ts}`, bundle it if it is available, and then emit the result
to `somewhere-else/not/a-worker-*.js`.

<Callout variant="warning">
  The difference between `customWorkerDest` and `customWorkerPrefix` is that the
  former only changes the output directory of the custom worker, whereas the
  latter also changes the URL the service worker uses to look for the custom
  worker. In the example above, the service worker will try to look for
  `/not/a-worker-*.js`, and it is your responsibility to serve it if you change
  `customWorkerDest` to something different from `public`.
