# Custom worker

`next-pwa` will automatically detect `worker/index.{js,ts}`, and bundle the file into `dest` as `worker-*.js` using `webpack`.
It's also automatically injected into the generated `sw.js`. In this way, you get the benefit of code splitting automatically.
You can share logic between your web app and this worker (path aliases do work). You can even import npm packages there!

This is where you can write your custom worker logic.

For example, to disable Workbox's logging, you can simply add `self.__WB_DISABLE_DEV_LOGS = true` to it.

You can change the directory in which `next-pwa` looks for a custom worker implementation, change its output directory, or
change its file structure:

```js
// title next.config.js
const withPWA = require("@ducanh2912/next-pwa").default({
  customWorkerSrc: "service-worker",
  customWorkerDest: "somewhere-else", // defaults to `dest`
  customWorkerPrefix: "not/a-worker",
  // ...
});

module.exports = withPWA({
  // Your Next.js config
});
```

```js
// title next.config.mjs
import withPWAInit from "@ducanh2912/next-pwa";

const withPWA = withPWAInit({
  customWorkerSrc: "service-worker",
  customWorkerDest: "somewhere-else", // defaults to `dest`
  customWorkerPrefix: "not/a-worker",
  // ...
});

export default withPWA({
  // Your Next.js config
});
```

</Tabs>

In this example, `next-pwa` will look for `service-worker/index.{js,ts}`, bundles it if it is available, then emits the result
to `somewhere-else/not/a-worker-*.js`.

<Callout variant="warning">
  The difference between `customWorkerDest` and `customWorkerPrefix` is that the
  former only changes the output directory of the custom worker, whereas the
  latter also changes the URL the service worker uses to look for the custom
  worker. In the example above, the service worker will try to look for
  `/not/a-worker-*.js`, and it is your responsibility to serve it if you change
  `customWorkerDest` to something different from `public`.
