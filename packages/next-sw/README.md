# Zero-config [PWA](https://web.dev/learn/pwa/) plugin for [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)

This plugin is powered by [Service Worker](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API) and other good stuff.

## How is it different from `@ducanh2912/next-pwa`?

It directly makes use of the `ServiceWorker` API instead of `workbox`. Both are supported, so just make a pick! If you are not sure, you may want to use `@ducanh2912/next-pwa` instead as it allows you to customize your service worker further.
