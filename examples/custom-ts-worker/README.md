# next-pwa - custom worker example

[TOC]

This example demonstrates how to use `next-pwa` plugin to turn a `next.js` based web application into a progressive web application easily. It demonstrates how to add custom worker code to the Service Worker generated by workbox.

## New Method

Simply create a `worker/index.ts` and start implementing your Service Worker. `next-pwa` will detect this file automatically, and bundle the file into `dest` as `worker-*.js` using `webpack`. It's also automatically injected into `sw.js` generated.

In this way, you get benefit of code splitting and size minimization automatically. Yes! `require` modules works! Yes! you can share codes between web app and the Service Worker!

> - In dev mode, `worker/index.ts` is not watched, so it will not hot reload.

### Custom Worker Directory

You can customize the directory of your custom worker file by setting the `customWorkerDir` relative to the `basedir` in the `pwa` section of your `next.config.js`:

```javascript
const withPWA = require("@ducanh2912/next-pwa").default({
  customWorkerDir: "serviceworker",
  // ...
});

module.exports = withPWA({
  // next.js config
});
```

In this example, `next-pwa` would look for `serviceworker/index.ts`.

## Old Method (Still Works)

Basically you need to create a file such as `worker.js` in `public` folder, then add an option `importScripts` to `pwa` object in `next.config.js`:

```javascript
const withPWA = require("@ducanh2912/next-pwa").default({
  dest: "public",
  importScripts: ["/worker.js"],
});

module.exports = withPWA({
  // next.js config
});
```

Then Service Worker generated will automatically import your code and run it before other workbox code.
