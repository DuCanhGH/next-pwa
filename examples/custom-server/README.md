# next-pwa - custom server example

[TOC]

This example demonstrates how to use `next-pwa` to turn a `Next.js`-based web app into a PWA easily.

It uses `fastify` as a custom server to serve `sw.js` and `precache` scripts statically, and it contains a minimal icon set and a `manifest.json` in the `public` directory. The example also features full offline support and boasts full (all 100) scores on Lighthouse ðŸŽ‰.
