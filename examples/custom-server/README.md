# next-pwa - custom server

This example demonstrates how to use serve a Next.js PWA with a custom server.

It uses `fastify` as a custom server to serve `sw.js` and `precache` scripts statically, and it contains a minimal icon set and a `manifest.json` in the `public` directory. The example also features full offline support and boasts full (all 100) scores on Lighthouse ðŸŽ‰.

> [Check out Lighthouse's summary](./lighthouse.pdf), or run the test yourself.

It is still recommended to use Next's built-in server instead.
