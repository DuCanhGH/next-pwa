# next-pwa - cache on frontend navigation example (deprecated)

Since `next-pwa@5.2.1`, you can set `cacheOnFrontEndNav: true` in your `pwa` config (or your `withPWAInit` config if you are on `next-pwa@5.6.0` and newer) to achieve the same result in this example before its deprecation, no extra code needed.
